# Cloud-based-Data-Engineering
This project analyzes Spotify dataset text files.
In its first part, several queries on the dataset answer the questions at the beginning of the file.
In the second part, a recommendation system is built using the ALS algorithm that recommends which singers should be listened to based on a singer we enter into the system.
In order to run this file, you are required to download the 2 attached text files, but the results are also attached to the Python file.
